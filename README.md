# Scheme Interpreter in ReasonML

This is an interpreter for the Lisp like programming language Scheme, written in ReasonML. The code follows closely chapter 4 of the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" by Abelson/Sussman.

I am writing this code as an exercise to learn ReasonML.
